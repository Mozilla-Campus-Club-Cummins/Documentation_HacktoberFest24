Feature engineering is the process of selecting, modifying, or creating new variables from raw data to improve machine learning model performance. 
It involves choosing relevant features, transforming them (like scaling or encoding), and generating new features from existing ones.
Effective feature engineering enhances model accuracy and interpretability.
